        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat a gas grill with all burners on High for 10 to 15 minutes. <br>
                Shape pizza dough and brush with olive oil.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Reduce the flame on half of the grill burners to Low, to create areas <br>
                of direct and indirect heat.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Carefully place dough (olive oil side facing down) onto the grill over <br>
                direct heat Close the cover. Let dough grill until the bottom is just barely <br>
                cooked and shows char marks, 1 to 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Use tongs to move dough to the indirect heat; do not flip dough over! <br>
                Cook 2 to 3 more minutes. Remove dough to a baking sheet.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Stir together 2 tablespoons sour cream, mayonnaise, and 1 1/2 teaspoons <br>
                Tajin seasoning. Spread sour cream mixture over dough. Mix remaining Tajin, <br>
                cotija, quesadilla cheese, corn, and red onions. Distribute topping mixture over dough.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Return pizza to grill. Grill until cheese is melted, about 3 minutes. <br>
                Carefully remove pizza from the grill. Scatter cilantro and jalape√±os <br>
                over pizza, and drizzle with additional sour cream. Mix melted butter <br>
                with remaining 1/2 teaspoon Tajin seasoning and brush crust with Tajin <br>
                butter. Cut into wedges and serve.
