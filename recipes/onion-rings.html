            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Whisk together buttermilk, egg, flour, chile and lime seasoning,<br>
                    and adobo seasoning for the batter in a shallow bowl.<br>
                    Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Combine panko, adobo seasoning, and chile and lime seasoning in a shallow dish;<br>
                    mix well. Remove batter from the fridge. Dip onion rings first into the batter,<br>
                    then into bread crumb mixture, turning to coat, and gently shake off excess crumbs.<br> 
                    Lightly spritz the onion rings with cooking spray on both sides.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Preheat the air fryer to 340 degrees F (170 degrees C). <br>
                    Line the air fryer basket with a parchment liner or lightly spray with oil.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Place the breaded onion rings into the fryer basket in an even layer,<br> 
                    leaving about 1/2-inch space between the slices.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Cook until crisp and lightly browned, flipping halfway through, 10 to 12 minutes. <br>
                    You may have to cook in batches, and cooking time may vary depending on the size<br>
                    and brand of your air fryer.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Remove from the air fryer, transfer to a baking sheet, sprinkle with kosher salt, <br>
                    and place in a 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) oven to keep warm.
